# My First Note

This is a simple example note with frontmatter metadata.

## What is Frontmatter?

Frontmatter is the YAML metadata at the top of the file, enclosed between `---` markers. It contains structured data about the note.

## Links to Other Notes

You can link to other notes using double brackets: [[Python Basics]] or [[Django Tutorial]].

## Content

Write your notes here in regular markdown:

- Bullet points work
- **Bold text** works
- *Italic text* works
- `code snippets` work

```python
# Code blocks work too
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
